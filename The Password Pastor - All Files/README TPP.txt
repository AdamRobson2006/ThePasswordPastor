Notes for TPP:

This program may not work on any other devices than my own, because the MySQL server storing the passwords and other relevant information are run off my computer, on Port 3306. Alterations may  have to be made to the program in order to have it working on devices universally. 

The idea behind this program was to simply create a Password Manager for my A Level Computer Science Project, which was in the end, graded at an A. Features you will find offered are a Critique System and Encryption System. I cannot guarantee that the others will work but this should hopefully show some of my experience with Python and SQL.

If you are able to get the program working, something to bare in mind is that I was pressed for time when making this project, and as a result had to abandon a few features and there may still be a few bugs in the program. I am aware of these but want to leave it in the state it was finished in. I can always come back and change things if needs be.
